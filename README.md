# Bank Account Simulation



## Description

This bank account simulation allows the user to deposit and withdraw money from their account. Interest calculations will be done on the account once a month and will (when initialized) increase the balance with @ 1% interest for the Checking Account (very good rate). If you get stuck like Fry in Futurama, you'll be grateful for the interest deposits. You can view your entire statement and see how much money you do have(or do not have). It's a no fee banking account, just make sure you don't try withdrawing money you don't have. That'll cost you 10$ (Overdraft fees are real).

## Code Used

- Python 3 & randint
