# Bank Account Simulation

## Description

This bank account simulation allows the user to deposit and withdraw money from their account. 

Interest calculations done on the account will (when initialized) take into account if it is a Checking or Savings and increase the balance with @ 1% or 1.2% interest rate. If you get stuck like Fry in Futurama, you'll be grateful for the interest deposits. 

You can view your entire statement and see how much money you do have(or do not have).

Withdrawing money you don't have will incur an overdraft fee. That'll cost you 10$ (Overdraft fees are a real thing).

## Code Used

- Python 3 & randint
